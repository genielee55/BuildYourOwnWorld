# BuildYourOwnWorld

BuildYourOwnWorld is a 2D tile-based world exploration engine with an overhead perspective, in which the player uses WASD to maneuver around obstacles and collect flowers to unlock a door and win the game. Each world is pseudorandomly generated (using the Random library), and saving/loading/replaying are possible with the Q (quit), L (load), and R (replay) keys.
